# Her Kind
### Anne Sexton

I have gone out, a possessed witch, <br>
haunting the black air, braver at night; <br>
dreaming evil, I have done my hitch <br>
over the plain houses, light by light: <br>
lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind. <br>
A woman like that is not a woman, quite. <br>
I have been her kind. <br>

I have found the warm caves in the woods, <br>
filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves, <br>
closets, silks, innumerable goods; <br>
fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves: <br>
whining, rearranging the disaligned. <br>
A woman like that is misunderstood. <br>
I have been her kind. <br>

I have ridden in your cart, driver, <br>
waved my nude arms at villages going by, <br>
learning the last bright routes, survivor <br>
where your flames still bite my thigh <br>
and my ribs crack where your wheels wind. <br>
<br>
A woman like that is not ashamed to die. <br>
I have been her kind. <br>
